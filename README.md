# Machine_Learning

This repository contains my personal exploration in machine learning.
It consists in separate projects i'm interested in, mostly using 
languages like Python and R.

1. How to get the standard deviation of the clusters when you use Kmeans (1D array)
2. Simple implementation of a generalized regression neural network in python
    based on example from: https://easyneuralnetwork.blogspot.com/2013/07/grnn-generalized-regression-neural.html
3. Models evaluation on Iris dataset, using grid of parameters and cross-validation.
